I met a fellow entrepreneur this weekend at a forum on BYU campus. He is
an aspiring individual, and is one of those future CEOs that has an
ability to light a spark in the people around him. He told me about an
idea he had. He was awesome, and his idea was crap.

His idea was, admittedly, 4 years old. Now, I know that some ideas take
that many years to catch on and get some traction. But the truth of the
matter is that, as he described it, his idea hadn’t evolved over that
time, and it showed. He needed to get brainstorming… Heck! He just
needed to be open to thinking!

<br/>
#### Openness, conversation, and listening

I can’t tell you how many times I had an idea that I was sure would
revolutionize “the industry” as we know it. I would plot and stew and
consider how my master plan would unfold, and then after two weeks of
discussion with other humans, would find out that it wasn’t really all
that good of an idea. That meant it was time to move on or change that
idea.

At first, an entrepreneur wants to rectify, justify and fortify his or
her idea. That’s fine as long as you are sure it’s what your market
wants, but to be clear… Josh James started with [MyComputer
Inc.](http://www.omniture.com/press/90) and then sold it for $1.8 billion as [Omniture](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandomniture.html). We all know [“The
face book”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) started as a tool for students at Harvard. Currently
the website used more for friendly connections and social interaction (I
don’t remember ever using it for school) is valued somewhere
between [$5 billion and $15 billion](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_33/b4096000952343.htm?chan=rss_topEmailedStories_ssi_5).

These companies wouldn’t be where they are today if they weren’t open to
change. There are 100 more examples like these.

<br/>
#### Distractions, gone

Phone calls, emails, meetings, family events and church callings are
necessary. And often our time is filled with these. Then we try and
squeeze other things like blogs, news, movies, social media, and
recreation -- it can be overwhelming.

You just need to realize that these things, blogs, news, and media are
only there to give you seeds. If you stock up on idea seeds but never
plant them, you will have a weak harvest, if a harvest at all.

Just turn off the radio sometimes and drive in silence. Ignore your RSS
feed, or Twitter stream every once in a while. Give your brain a chance
to nourish what’s there already, rather than continuously stuffing more
in.

Pull out some writing tools and quietly ponder.

<br/>
#### Stay alert and up-to-date

You may think this last piece contrary to the second, and I hope it
becomes clear exactly why it is not.

Oftentimes as I ponder on my ideas, I start running circles in my own
realm of experience and vision. While you ponder and create, you may
wonder what is out there already. You may wonder how far you can stretch
your idea.

As long as it doesn’t become a distraction, research is a wonderful tool
to keep your ideas fresh and powerful. Now, nothing can replace quiet
contemplation. But if you want to make an idea work, you need to study,
and search the world around you for how that industry has evolved since
you thought it up.

Especially if it’s been 4 years.
